# yelpcamp
My version of the yelpcamp web app from the web development bootcamp class (https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/t/lecture/4057580?start=0)

## A few tweaks - 
* no slideshow on the splash page because I don't like them. I find them distracting.
* source is different in largely minor ways, mostly trying to DRY stuff up. 
* base css file, add another css file with the "myCss" variable
* message keys array instead of listing them out manually
* patched with the fixes noted here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDWPJAzlBfM&feature=youtu.be
* seed database includes authors
* add clearfixes to thumbnail gallery of campgrounds (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid-responsive-resets)
